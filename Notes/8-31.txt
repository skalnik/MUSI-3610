Music (from the Muses)
* Muses inspired creativity
The Muses
* Kalliope is the eldest of the muses: goddess of song (Kallioph, Kallipeia, Calliope) daughter of Zeus and Titan Goddess Mnemosyne (Goddess of memory & time)
* Kalliope's son is Orpheus; poet/singer/lyre master & greatest of human musicians.
* Dionysus overhears Orpheus singing priase to Helios (Sun God sometimes identified as Apollo), Jealous, DIonysus looses the Bakkhantes (women follwers of Dionysus maddened by wine/sensuality) to dismember Orpheus.
Apollo
* Son of Zeus
* God of light, truth, intellect, archery, medicine, music, poetry, and prophetic vision (the oracles).
* Master of the lyre and kithara (Persian ancestor of guitar)
"Artistic Polarity"
* Early implications of spiritual art/music; free will, life's choices, paths or stages ("the ages" of men & women: child, adolescent, maturity, old age).
* Dionysian: prioritize the emotional, the power of human feelings (the adolescent heart in the moment, passion, youth) and the forces of nature expressed in art.
* Apllonian: Artistic expression of intellect, form, balance, sophistication, the most elevated expression of the human mind (maturity, beauty, elegance)

Equal Temperament
* In Pythagorean or Just tuning systems, intervals are derived via ratio 4:3, 5:4, 6:5, etc.
* In Equal Temperament, each half step interval is equidistant, derived by geometric esquence (logorhythm)
* For this course, implications; all 12 tones are equidistant; facilitates modulation, large ensembles.
More terms related to melody
* Range - the parameter of a melody (lowest/highest)
* Shape/Contour - graphic description (waves, arc, rising line)
* Conjunct/Disjunct - motion by small or large interval
* Phrase - A significant portion of a melody, described by natural points of tension or rest
Countermelody
* Melodies are not always in motion (sustained notes, points of rest etc.) and at these points, another significant melodic idea can grace the main idea
* Countermelody is a secondary figure; a melody that complements the main melody momentarily (it is not the main idea nor is it a background accompanying figure)

* Meters are widely varied, but the most common meters in Western music are 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12 beats per measure
* Meter is indicated by time signature
