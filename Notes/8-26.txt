Melody
* Succession of pitches perceived as a whole
* Variation and development
* Singable and memorable
* Melody is often the raison d'etre of a composition; all else follows from the melody
* In longer works, melodies may be referred to as themes
What is a Good Melody?
* Ode to Joy
* Semi-tones, very singable. Much like children's songs. Easy to sing for the most ignorant among us.
* Home note is G, last note of the main phrase. Hard to identify, but if changed, very obvious.
* Second phrase is the same thing, except to the last bar which is slightly different.
* The third phrase is very different, a bit quicker. It circles the second degree of the scale (G) and ends on the 5th degree
* Last phrase is the same as the first. It ties this back to the start, using the most memorable part of the entire piece.
Pitch
* A specific sound expressed by name and vibrations per second; vibration results in compression of air which we can sense.
* 12 different pitches represented by 7 letters of the alphabet and use of modifiers; flats & sharps.
* Pitch names repeat at multiples with sepcific number identifier (ex: 440, 880, 1760 = A4, A5, & A6).
* C-C#-D-D#-E-F-F#-G-G#-A-A#-B-C1-C#1
* Some orchestras now tune to 442, and some to even 445.
* Movies will sometimes increase pitch of the score by almost a quarter tone to brighten the music.
Interval
* The distance between 2 pitches
* Can be expressed specifically (but not in this course)
* Expressed comparatively (narrow, medium, wide movement in a melody or interval) a goal for students in this course
* Half steps and whole steps: basic material of modes and scales
* Melodys have to use a mix of intervals, if they didn't it wouldn't be natural
Western Roots (Don't need to know)
* Pythagoras (6th century BC) and Ptolemy (ca. 83-161 AD) observed physical properties of cibrating bodies, such as; halving a string doubles the vps; we perceive (universally) the same "tone or pitch" one octave higher (2:1), 4ths and 5ths (3:2 and 4:32) also observed then other ratios extrapolated
* Timothesus (ca. 480 BC) musicians epic poem survives of Salamis naval battle (follows Thermopylae), in which Greeks defeat the Persian navy
* Aristoxenus, in 330 BC made the first (preserved) theoretical references
* Greek Philosphers associated modes/scales with various emotions, mental states
* Music associated with the highest sciences, perceived as a gift from the Gods, and used in worship in the Greek cults
Dionysus
* Dionysus depicted with satyr (lover?), graphes, panther (nature's unruled strength)
  * Naturalistic life & philophy
  * Birth of theatre (relating life lessons)
  * Sensuality, love, orgiastic worship
  * Associated with evocative, loud instruments: Aulos
  * Satrs, nymphs, Pan (pan pipes)
Aulos
* Banded to the player's head for support in outdoor processions
* Two reed instruments played by one player
* Limited to a few notes
Music (from the muses)
* Muses inspired creativity
