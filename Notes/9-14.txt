Papal Power
* "Certain disciples of the new school, much occupying themselves with the measured dividing of time, display their method in notes which are new to us … with these notes of small value every composition is pestered. Moreover…sometimes even they stuff [the music] with upper parts made out of secular song. We now hasten therefore to banish these methods…and to put htem to flight more effectually that heretofore, far from the house of God." - Pope John XXII, 1317
